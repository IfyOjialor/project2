## Introduction

In this project, we will use a bike-sharing dataset to create machine
learning models. Before moving forward, I will briefly explain the
bike-sharing system and how it works. A bike-sharing system is a service
in which users can rent/use bicycles on a short term basis for a fee.
The goal of these programs is to provide affordable access to bicycles
for short distance trips as opposed to walking or taking public
transportation. Imagine how many people use these systems on a given
day, the numbers can vary greatly based on some elements. The goal of
this project is to build a predictive model to find out the number of
people that use these bikes in a given time period using available
information about that time/day. This in turn, can help businesses that
oversee this systems to manage them in a cost efficient manner.  
We will be using the bike-sharing dataset from the UCL Machine Learning
Repository. We will use the regression and boosted tree method to model
the response variable `cnt`.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

First we will read in the data using a relative path.

``` r
#read in data and filter to desired weekday
day1 <- read.csv("Bike-Sharing-Dataset/day.csv")
head(day1,5)
```

    ##   instant     dteday season yr mnth holiday
    ## 1       1 2011-01-01      1  0    1       0
    ## 2       2 2011-01-02      1  0    1       0
    ## 3       3 2011-01-03      1  0    1       0
    ## 4       4 2011-01-04      1  0    1       0
    ## 5       5 2011-01-05      1  0    1       0
    ##   weekday workingday weathersit     temp
    ## 1       6          0          2 0.344167
    ## 2       0          0          2 0.363478
    ## 3       1          1          1 0.196364
    ## 4       2          1          1 0.200000
    ## 5       3          1          1 0.226957
    ##      atemp      hum windspeed casual registered
    ## 1 0.363625 0.805833  0.160446    331        654
    ## 2 0.353739 0.696087  0.248539    131        670
    ## 3 0.189405 0.437273  0.248309    120       1229
    ## 4 0.212122 0.590435  0.160296    108       1454
    ## 5 0.229270 0.436957  0.186900     82       1518
    ##    cnt
    ## 1  985
    ## 2  801
    ## 3 1349
    ## 4 1562
    ## 5 1600

Next, we will remove the *casual* and *registered* variables since the
`cnt` variable is a combination of both.

``` r
day1 <- select(day1, -casual, -registered) 
day1$weekday <- as.factor(day1$weekday)
levels(day1$weekday) <- c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday")
day <- filter(day1, weekday == params$days)

#Check for missing values
miss <- data.frame(apply(day,2,function(x){sum(is.na(x))}))
names(miss)[1] <- "missing"
miss
```

    ##            missing
    ## instant          0
    ## dteday           0
    ## season           0
    ## yr               0
    ## mnth             0
    ## holiday          0
    ## weekday          0
    ## workingday       0
    ## weathersit       0
    ## temp             0
    ## atemp            0
    ## hum              0
    ## windspeed        0
    ## cnt              0

There are no missing values in the dataset, so we can continue with our
analysis.

``` r
#Change the variables into their appropriate format.
day$season <- as.factor(day$season)
day$weathersit <- as.factor(day$weathersit)
day$holiday <- as.factor(day$holiday)
day$workingday <- as.factor(day$workingday)
day$yr <- as.factor(day$yr)
day$mnth <- as.factor(day$mnth)

levels(day$season) <- c("winter", "spring", "summer", "fall")
levels(day$yr) <- c("2011", "2012")
str(day)
```

    ## 'data.frame':    105 obs. of  14 variables:
    ##  $ instant   : int  1 8 15 22 29 36 43 50 57 64 ...

### Univariate Analysis

The `cnt` is the response variable, so we’ll use a histogram to get a
visual understanding of the variable.

``` r
ggplot(day, aes(x = cnt)) + theme_bw() + geom_histogram(aes(y =..density..), color = "black", fill = "white", binwidth = 1000) + geom_density(alpha = 0.2, fill = "blue") + labs(title = "Count Density", x = "Count", y = "Density")
```

![](Saturday_files/figure-gfm/cnt-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
summary(day$cnt)
```

    ##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
    ##     627    2732    4521    4551    6140    8714

From the histogram and summary statistics output, it is pretty evident
that the count of total rental bikes are in the sub 5000 range. We will
investigate if there is a relationship between the response variable and
other relevant predictor variables in the next section. Lets look at the
other variables individually.

``` r
#visualize numeric predictor variables using a histogram
p1 <- ggplot(day) + geom_histogram(aes(x = temp), fill = "red", binwidth = 0.03)
p2 <- ggplot(day) + geom_histogram(aes(x = atemp), fill = "red", binwidth = 0.03)
p3 <- ggplot(day) + geom_histogram(aes(x = hum), fill = "red", binwidth = 0.025)
p4 <- ggplot(day) + geom_histogram(aes(x = windspeed), fill = "red", binwidth = 0.03)
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1,p2,p3,p4, nrow = 2)
```

![](Saturday_files/figure-gfm/EDA_num-1.png)<!-- -->

Observations:  
\* No clear cut pattern in `temp`and `atemp`.

  - `hum` appears to be skewed to the left when the dataset is not
    filtered to a specific weekday.

  - `windspeed` appears to be skewed(right). This variable should be
    transformed to curb its skewness.

  - The distribution of `temp` and `atemp` looks very similar. We should
    think about taking out one of the variables.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
#visualize categorical predictor variables
h1 <- ggplot(day) + geom_bar(aes(x = season),fill = "pink")
h2 <- ggplot(day) + geom_bar(aes(x = yr),fill = "pink")
h3 <- ggplot(day) + geom_bar(aes(x = holiday),fill = "pink")
h4 <- ggplot(day) + geom_bar(aes(x = workingday),fill = "pink")
h5 <- ggplot(day) + geom_bar(aes(x = mnth),fill = "pink")
h6 <- ggplot(day) + geom_bar(aes(x = weathersit),fill = "pink")
gridExtra::grid.arrange(h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6, nrow = 3)
```

![](Saturday_files/figure-gfm/EDA_cat-1.png)<!-- -->

Observations:  
\* The variation between the four seasons is little to none.

  - About the same number of people rode bikes in 2011 and 2012.

  - Many people rode bikes on days that are not holidays.

  - Most people used the bike-sharing system on days that were neither
    weekends nor holidays.

  - Most people used the bike sharing system on days with clear weather.

### Bi-variate Analysis

In this section, we will explore the predictor variables with respect to
the response variable. The objective is to discover hidden relationships
between the independent and response variables and use those findings in
the model building process.

``` r
# First, we will explore the relationship between the target and numerical variables.
p1 <- ggplot(day) +geom_point(aes(x = temp, y = cnt), colour = "violet") + labs(title = "Normalized Temperature vs Total Rental Bikes")
p2 <- ggplot(day) +geom_point(aes(x = atemp, y = cnt), colour = "#FF99CC") +labs(title = "Normalized Feeling Temperature vs Total Rental Bikes")
p3 <- ggplot(day) +geom_point(aes(x = hum, y = cnt), colour = "pink") + labs(title = "Normalized Humidity vs Total rental Bikes")
p4 <- ggplot(day) +geom_point(aes(x = windspeed, y = cnt), colour = "#FF66CC") +labs(title= "Normalized Windspeed vs Total rental Bikes")
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, nrow = 2)
```

![](Saturday_files/figure-gfm/bi_var_num-1.png)<!-- -->

Observations:  
\* There appears to be a positive linear relationship between `cnt` ,
`temp`, and `atemp`.

  - There is also a weak relationship between `cnt`, `hum`, and
    `windspeed`.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# Now we'll visualize the relationship between the target and categorical variables.
# Instead of using a boxplot, I will use a violin plot which is the blend of both a boxplot and density plot
g1 <- ggplot(day) + geom_col(aes(x = yr, y = cnt, fill = season))+theme_bw()
g2 <- ggplot(day) + geom_violin(aes(x = yr, y = cnt))+theme_bw()
g3 <- ggplot(day) + geom_col(aes(x = mnth, y = cnt, fill = season))+theme_bw() 
g4 <- ggplot(day) + geom_col(aes(x = holiday, y = cnt, fill = season)) + theme_bw() 
g6 <- ggplot(day) + geom_col(aes(x = workingday, y = cnt, fill = season))
g7 <- ggplot(day) + geom_col(aes(x = weathersit, y = cnt, fill = season))
gridExtra::grid.arrange(g1, g2, g3, nrow = 2)
```

![](Saturday_files/figure-gfm/bivar_cat-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
gridExtra::grid.arrange(g4, g6, g7, nrow = 2)
```

![](Saturday_files/figure-gfm/bivar_cat-2.png)<!-- --> Observations:  
\* The total bike rental count is higher in 2012 than 2011.

  - During workingday, the bike rental counts quite the highest compared
    to during no working day for different seasons.

  - During clear,partly cloudy weather, the bike rental count is highest
    and the second highest is during mist cloudy weather and followed by
    third highest during light snow and light rain weather.

  - The highest bike rental count was during the summer and lowest in
    the winter.

## Correlation Matrix

Correlation matrix helps us to understand the linear relationship
between variables.

``` r
day_c <- day[ , c(10:14)]
round(cor(day_c), 2)
```

    ##            temp atemp   hum windspeed   cnt
    ## temp       1.00  1.00  0.07     -0.16  0.63
    ## atemp      1.00  1.00  0.09     -0.18  0.64
    ## hum        0.07  0.09  1.00     -0.21 -0.11
    ## windspeed -0.16 -0.18 -0.21      1.00 -0.28
    ## cnt        0.63  0.64 -0.11     -0.28  1.00

From the above matrix, we can see that `temp` and `atemp` are highly
correlated. So we only need to include one of these variables in the
model to prevent multicollinearity. We will also transform the humidity
and windspeed variable.

``` r
day <- mutate(day, log_hum = log(day$hum+1))
day <- mutate(day, log_ws = log(day$windspeed + 1))

#Remove irrelevant variables
day <- select(day, -weekday,-holiday,-workingday,-dteday,-temp, -instant)
```

## Model Building

First we split the data into train and test sets.

``` r
set.seed(23)
dayIndex<- createDataPartition(day$cnt, p = 0.7, list=FALSE)
dayTrain <- day[dayIndex, ]
dayTest <- day[-dayIndex, ]

# Build a tree-based model using loocv;
fitTree <- train(cnt~ ., data = dayTrain, method = "rpart", 
              preProcess = c("center", "scale"), 
              trControl = trainControl(method = "loocv", number = 10), tuneGrid = data.frame(cp = 0.01:0.10))
```

Now, we make predictions on the test data sets using the best model
fits. Then we compare RMSE to determine the best model.

``` r
predTree <- predict(fitTree, newdata = select(dayTest, -cnt))
postResample(predTree, dayTest$cnt)
```

    ##         RMSE     Rsquared          MAE 
    ## 1279.9443248    0.6791617 1031.9067668

``` r
boostPred <- predict(fitBoost, newdata = select(dayTest, -cnt))
postResample(boostPred, dayTest$cnt)
```

    ##         RMSE     Rsquared          MAE 
    ## 1018.9523845    0.8092966  861.6383337

When we compare the two models, the boosted tree model has lower RMSE
values when applied on the test dataset. Hence, the boosted tree model
is our final model and best model for interpreting the bike rental count
on a daily basis.
